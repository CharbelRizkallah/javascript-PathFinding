- By clicking on any of the squares on the purple board, it will create a wall square, which can't be used as a path.
- By clicking the left bottom square, you will be able to place point A (green) on any of the purple squares on the board.
- By clicking the right bottom square, you will be able to place point B (red) on any of the purple squares on the board.
- Once both point A and point B are on the board, the program will show the path that was found depending on the algorithm used. The path will be shown as white squares.
- When a path is found the squares that have been checked, but not chosen for the path, will be colored dark purple. This way we can see the difference in efficiency between the algorithms.
- To change the algorithm used to find the path, you can use the select box in the top left corner.

Note: DFS (Depth Fisrt Search) is kind of messy, because it is the least efficient algorithm and because of the order the algorithm checks nodes.
The algorithms check neighboor nodes in this order: Top Left, Top Middle, Top Right, Middle Left, Middle Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Middle, Bottom Right.
